## The Task
We have been tasked to develop a way to visualize United States Geological Survey, USGS. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards. We have to help them visualize this data as it can be used to inform both the general public and government organizations on potential and actual hazards that happen. We do this by creating a map that serves as a means to visualize earthquakes. First, we have to access USGS website at: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php and select a dataset. For this challenge I selected earthquakes within the last 7 days. Second, we have to import and visualize that data using Leaflet. Leaflet is an open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. With leaflet we create the map with the imported data and set it up to our liking as well as provide context.

## Navigating this repository
You can find the code for this repository in the Leaflet-Part-1 folder. At another time I may come back and finish the optional Leaflet-Part-2 folder which will add additional functionality that is not currently included. This folder holds the completed files in the static directory which holds our css and js. This folder also holds the index.html file which can be initialized to get the visualization going locally on your browser. 

## Data Provided
For this tasks we were provided several files. They include the index.html file which contained the foundation of our application, the style.css document which stored some formatting information, and the logic.js file which we had to fill with code that would allow the visualization to come to life. We had to obtain json data by using the url that the USGS provided which lists the last 7 days worth of earthquake data when opened in JSON format: "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson".

## Code Sources
The code in this repository was sourced from starter code provided by the bootcamp as well as from in-class activities, Mozilla Developer Network, and documentation libraries for Leaflet.js for certain aspects of this challenge. At times I did have to utilize google for simple queries and information.
